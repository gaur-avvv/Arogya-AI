## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the Model (if needed)
```bash
python train_model.py
```
This creates `random_forest_model.pkl` with all necessary components.

### 3. Run the Model
```bash
python arogya_predict.py
```

### 4. Interactive Mode
For personalized assessment, run the script and choose interactive mode when prompted:
```bash
python arogya_predict.py
```


## Enhanced Features

### üåø Comprehensive Dosha Selection
The system now includes a detailed Ayurvedic body type assessment with 6 constitution types:
- **Vata** (Air_Space_Constitution) - Thin/Lean: Naturally thin build, difficulty gaining weight, dry skin, cold hands/feet
- **Pitta** (Fire_Water_Constitution) - Medium: Medium build, good muscle tone, warm body, strong appetite  
- **Kapha** (Earth_Water_Constitution) - Heavy/Large: Naturally larger build, gains weight easily, cool moist skin, steady energy
- **Vata-Pitta** (Air_Fire_Mixed_Constitution) - Thin to Medium: Variable build, creative energy, moderate body temperature
- **Vata-Kapha** (Air_Earth_Mixed_Constitution) - Thin to Heavy: Variable patterns, irregular tendencies, sensitive to changes
- **Pitta-Kapha** (Fire_Earth_Mixed_Constitution) - Medium to Heavy: Strong stable build, good strength, balanced metabolism

### üìä Calibrated Confidence Scoring
The system now uses sophisticated confidence calibration that considers the gap between the top prediction and second-best prediction to provide more realistic confidence estimates:
- Large gap between predictions: Higher confidence possible (up to 98%)
- Medium gap: Moderate confidence (up to 95%)
- Small gap: Conservative confidence (up to 85%)

### üéØ Top-5 Predictions
Instead of just one prediction, the system provides a ranked list of the 5 most likely diseases with their confidence percentages.
